                World War One initiated due to the assasination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Because of this, Serbia was declared war on by Austria-Hungary, beginning the first world war. Luxembourg and Belgium were invaded by Germany while Alsace was invaded by France. Forces from Great Britain arrive in France. There were many nations allied against Germany, and the allied forces began to increase.

              After the halt of unrestricted submarine warfare after sinking of Lusitania, Germany finally returns to it on February 1, 1917. Two days later, the United States severs diplomatic relations with Germany. And on April 6, 1917, the United States declares war on Germany. General John J. Pershing becomes the newly selected commander of the American Expeditionary Forces about two months later; he arrives in England with his staff. Soon after, American combat forces arrive in France. It is not until mid-December when Russia signs armstice with Germany.
