Two days later, the United States severs diplomatic relations with Germany. And on April 6, 1917, the United States declares war on Germany. General John J. Pershing becomes the newly selected commander of the American Expeditionary Forces about two months later; he arrives in England with his staff. Soon after, American combat forces arrive in France.

            <p>
              A draft of the covenant of the League of Nations is completed. The USA decided not to take part in it, since it was in their best interest to be independent. Respresentatives from the Allied and Germany sign the Treaty of Versailles on November 19, 1919. However, the United States Senate failed to ratify it. What the USA did instead was sign the Treaty of Guaranty, "pledging to defend France in case of an unprovoked attack by Germany." The Treaty of Versailles takes effect on January 10, 1920.
