                                The oldest permanent European settlement, older than even Jamestown or Plymouth, was founded on September of 1565 by a Spanish soldier named Pedro Menéndez de Avilés in St. Augustine, Florida. Tasked with the mission of remove French Huguenot colonists, Menéndez was ready to go to battle. Spain's King Philip II wanted the French elminated for multiple reasons. As a catholic, he couldnt stand how they were Protestants. The french had also previously established an outpost. This base posed threat to Spanish territorial claims and the Spanish treasure fleet. Menéndez's mission didnt come without trouble. Hoping to arrive before the French could recieve reinforcements, they tried to hastily make their way to the fort. But it was too late. Backup had already arrived. Outnumbered, Menéndez and his men retreated. A head on battle would lead to their defeat, but nature had their back. A large storm blew the french fleet away sinking them. Within the next couple of days, the Spaniards made their move. Sneaking into the french fort at the break of dawn, they slaughtered more than 140 Frenchmen. later at their encampment they were notified of surviving soldiers from the blown away fleets. They rushed to the location and gave them two options. Convert or die. 16 were willing, but the 111 other soldiers were killed. After a victory, the Spaniards decided to establish St. Augustine as a permanent colony to deter more French from settling. The Spanish soon realized St. Augustine offered a valuable base for rescuers to help their trading ships when they were battered by tropical storms, as well as for warships needed to hunt pirates. As a result, the colony was heavily subsidized.

                                On December 6, 1606, the journey to Virginia began. In 1607, 104 English men and boys arrived in North America to start a settlement. On May 13 they picked Jamestown, Virginia for their settlement, which was named after their king, James I. The settlement became the first permanent English settlement in North America. Following the Virginia Companys criteria, Jamestown had all the components for the perfect settlement location. It was surrounded by water on 3 sides and far inland; both of which meant it was easily defensible against Spanish attacks. The water was also deep enough that the English could tie their ships at the shoreline. And lastly the site was not inhabited by the Native Population. After the spot was chosen, instructions sent by the Virginia Company containing a list of to-be council members was read. The first president of the colony was to be Edward Maria Winfield. The other six were: Bartholomew Gosnold, Christopher Newport, John Martin, John Ratcliffe, George Kendall, and John Smith. By June 15, the fort was completed. On June 22, Captain Newport left for England to get more supplies for the new settlement, but not long after the colony succumbed to various diseases. Their drinking water was dirty, there was famine, and they found themselves in various battles. Had it not been for gifts from the Chief of the Powhatan Indians they would've perished. However the relationship was not long last. The English demanded too much food. On the brink of collapse and before the plan of abandonment, Jamestown was met with news on an incoming fleet. It was bringing a new governor, Lord Delaware. In 1612, John Rolfe, one of many shipwrecked on Bermuda, helped turn the settlement into a profitable venture. He introduced a new strain of tobacco from seeds which soon became their long awaited cash crop. On July 30, 1619, newly appointed Governor Yeardley called for the first representative legislative assembly. Also in 1619, the Virginia Company recruited and shipped over about 90 women to become wives and start families in Virginia, something needed to establish a permanent colony.

                            On December 18th, 1620, the English ship Mayflower lands on modern-day Plymouth, Massachusetts. The crew onboard began their preparations to start a new settlment, the Plymouth Colony. The story of the Mayflower began in 1606, when a group of reform-minded Puritans in Nottinghamshire, England, founded their own church, separate from the state-sanctioned Church of England. Accused of treason, they were forced to leave the country an settle somewhere more tolerant. After 12 years of struggling to adapt and make a decent living, the group sought financial backing from some London merchants to set up a colony in America.
