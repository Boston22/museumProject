                  <h2>When He Was Born</h2>
                  <em>January 17th, 1899</em>
                          <p>
                            Born of an immigrant family in Brooklyn, New York in 1899, Al Capone quit school after the sixth grade and associated with a notorious street gang, becoming accepted as a member. Johnny Torrio was the street gang leader and among the other members was Lucky Luciano, who would later attain his own notoriety.
                              </p>

                        <p>
                          Al, the fourth of nine children, grew up in Brooklyn, New York. He attended school until the sixth grade, whence he dropped out at age 14 after striking a teacher. He worked a variety of odd jobs—as a candy store clerk, a bowling alley pinboy, a labourer in an ammunition plant, and a cutter in a book bindery—all the while serving in the South Brooklyn Rippers and Forty Thieves Juniors, two “kid gangs”—that is, bands of delinquent children known for vandalism and petty crime that were  common in New York at the time.Capone also became a member of the James Street Boys gang during this period, which was run by Johnny Torrio, the man that would become his lifelong mentor, and associated with the Five Points gang. At age 16 Capone became a member of the Five Points gang and served aspiring mobster Francesco Ioele (Torrio’s associate, more commonly known as Frankie Yale) as a bartender in Yale’s brothel-saloon, the Harvard Inn.

                <h3>Why he died and what made him different.</h3>
                <em>March 3rd, 1920</em>
                <p>
                    While there were plenty of gangsters who made headlines in the Roaring Twenties, Chicago mobster Al Capone always stood out from the pack. In the span of just a decade, Capone rose from being a street thug to the FBI’s “Public Enemy No. 1.” But it was also the bizarre nature of Al Capone’s death that further differentiated him from his peers.

                    While he was still a low-ranking gangster and bouncer at a bordello, Capone contracted syphilis. He chose to leave this disease untreated, which ultimately led to an untimely demise at just 48.
